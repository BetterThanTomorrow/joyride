# Welcome to Joyride! ðŸŽ¸

Joyride lets you script VS Code using ClojureScript. This is your user Joyride directory where you can create scripts that enhance your VS Code experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Script
Use VS Code commands to create your first Joyride scripts:
- **Create User Activate Script** - Runs automatically when Joyride starts
- **Create Hello Joyride User Script** - Example script to run manually

### 2. Install Calva (Recommended)
For the best Joyride development experience, install the Calva extension:
- Provides syntax highlighting and REPL support
- Use `Calva: Start Joyride REPL and Connect` to interact with your scripts

### 3. Explore Examples
Check out the Joyride examples repository:
https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/joyride/tree/master/examples

### 4. Run Scripts
- Use `Joyride: Run User Script` to run your scripts
- Scripts in this directory can access the full VS Code API

## Directory Structure

- `scripts/` - Your Joyride scripts go here
- `src/` - Reusable Clojure code (created when needed)
- `deps.edn` - Clojure dependencies (created when needed)
