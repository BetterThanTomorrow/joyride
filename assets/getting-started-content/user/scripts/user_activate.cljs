;; This is the Joyride User `activate.cljs` script. It will run
;; as the first thing when Joyride is activated, making it a good
;; place for you to initialize things. E.g. install event handlers,
;; print motivational messages, or whatever.

;; You can run this and other User scripts with the VS Code command:
;;   *Joyride: Run User Script*

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;; REPL practice
(comment
  ;; To work with the scripts interactively, install the Calva Extension
  ;; Use Calva to start the Joyride REPL and connect it. The command:
  ;;   *Calva: Start Joyride REPL and Connect*
  ;; Then evaluate some code in this Rich comment block. Or just write
  ;; some new code and evaluate that. Or whatever. It's fun!
