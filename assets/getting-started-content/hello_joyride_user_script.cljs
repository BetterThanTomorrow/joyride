;; runs it. See the README at: 
;;    https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/joyride/

;; You probably also want to install the Calva VS Code Extension.
;; New to Calva and/or Clojure? Use the Calva command:
;;   *Fire up the Getting Started REPL*
;; It will guide you through the basics.

;; Use Calva to start the Joyride REPL and connect it.
;; There's a REPL button in the status bar that will show you
;; a menu where Joyride is one of the options.

;; Then evaluate some code in this Rich comment block. (Place
;; the cursor in some code and press `Alt/Option+Enter`)
;; Or write some new code and evaluate that. Or whatever.
;; It's fun!

;; When loading this file in the REPL, using the command:
;;   *Calva: Load Current File and Dependencies*
;; the following call to `my-main` will not be made. Because
;; you are not invoking the file as a script.

(when (= (joyride/invoked-script) joyride/*file*)

;; Call `my-main` by placing the cursor next to, and outside
;; the opening or closing parens, then press `Ctrl+Enter`.
