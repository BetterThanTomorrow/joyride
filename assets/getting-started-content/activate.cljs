;; This is the Joyride User `activate.cljs` script. It will run
;; as the first thing when Joyride is activated, making it a good
;; place for you to initialize things. E.g. install event handlers,
;; print motivational messages, or whatever.

;; You can run this and other User scripts with the command:
;;   *Joyride: Run User Script*

(comment
  ;; Use Calva to start the Joyride REPL and connect it. Then
  ;; evaluate some code in this Rich comment block. Or just write
  ;; sme new code and evaluate that. Or whatever. It's fun!

  ;; New to Calva and/or Clojure? Use the Calva command:
  ;;   *Fire up the Getting Started REPL*
  ;; It will guide you through the basics.
